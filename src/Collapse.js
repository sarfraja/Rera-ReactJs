      The Rental Process +
    </MDBBtn>
        <MDBCollapse id="Collapse2" isOpen={this.state.collapseID}>
         <center><h2>The Rental Process</h2>
        <img src="/logo/rental.png" className="align-center" alt="bulamadım" height="500px" width="700px" />
        <h2>Step 1:   Property Valuation</h2>
        <p>Let expert agents take a look at your property and determine the highest achievable rent in line with market rents. Our experience will guarantee that your property won't stand empty for long.<br />
        This is why we consistently achieve the asking price across all our clients properties.
        </p>
        <h2>Step 2: Choose an agent</h2>
        <p>Upon choosing Up Rera Consultant team you can count on a professional team, which will work hard for you seven days a week to market your property via our web-site, all major national and international property portals, as well as our extensive client network.</p>
       <h2>Step 3:  Clean & prepare</h2>
       <p>The more presentable a property the more rent it will fetch. As Uttar Pradesh market is maturing, tenants have become more discerned. Therefore make sure you have your property professionally cleaned inside.</p>
        <h2>Step 4:  Market the property</h2>
        <p>Too often you find properties advertised where image and the individual property don't match. We will put together an honest description of your property highlighting its selling points and include photos showing it in its best light.</p>
        <h2>Step 5: Viewings</h2>
        <p>Our RERA licensed agents will take potential tenants around your property at a time that suits them. Meaning we are available during evenings and weekends as well as our normal working hours. We don't just send anyone but an agent with in-depth knowledge on your property; prospective tenants are less likely to deal with an agency, which looks like they have no idea, what they are talking about. A professional knowledgeable area specialist with a good attitude and general market knowledge instill trust into a client which is crucial for making that all important lease agreement.</p>
        <h2>Step 6:  Negotiate an offer</h2>
        <p>Keeping your minimum requirements in mind we will try and get you the best offer. However, if we feel that the property will move slowly i.e. in an area of low demand/oversupply we may suggest you to be flexible with the numbers of cheques for example, reducing rent can also be an option if there is a risk of the property standing empty for too many weeks / months.</p>
        <h2>Step 7:  Tenant screening</h2>
        <p>We will then vet the interested party; ask for passport ID, Address proof and 2 photograph, and in the case that the tenant is a company, a copy of their company trade license, passport of the head of the company. Of course our agent dealing with the tenant will also be able to give you his personal feedback on how they came across i.e. likely to look after your property, We will also understand how big the family is and what profession they are in and whether they have pets or not.</p>
        <h2>Step 8:  Agreeing to let</h2>
        <p>Once you agree to the offer, we will collect a security deposit from the prospective tenant.</p>
        <h2>Step 9:  Signing tenancy agreement</h2>
        <p>We will provide you and the tenant with a draft copy of the contract and should there be any additional conditions to be added by either party then we will do so accordingly. The contract will also feature specifics about how the maintenance of the property will be taken care of, and the terms of payment from tenant to landlord. We will collect the full amount of the rent payments and pass them on to the landlord before we hand over the keys to the tenant. </p>
